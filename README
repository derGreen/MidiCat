#             - Midi Cat -
#   create Bongocat notes form Midi


# How to
MIDI file has to convert to a CSV file (so its more a CSV to BongoCat converter, but this will change in future)

-Start midiCat.exe in cmd with CSV file as parameter
-Channel?, chose the midi channel with the Melodic line you need, 0 to 15 (channel 0 is only the Header, channel 10 is normally Drums) you have to try. 
### no octave shift in this version !
-Octave shift?, !Bongo+ has only 3 Octaves (C3 to H5) so Midi notes greater than this rollover and become lower notes again.  
### Normal Note C4 is Midi value 60 is Keyboard key "Q" or "1" in BongoCat 
    When Octave Shift is 0 Bongo Key Q/1 is C3  
    When Octave Shift is 1 Bongo Key Q/1 is C4 (default)
    When Octave Shift is 2 Bongo Key Q/1 is C5
-speed? You can change speed. Higer speed will slow down the song, but the notes become more precise on beat, so play on higher !bpm.       

-Copy, paste text in chat, BongoCat will play it. 

Program is WIP, and will be changed daily
