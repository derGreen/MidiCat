# How to
MIDI file has to convert to a CSV file (so its more an scv to BongoCat converter, but this will change in future)

-Start midiCat.exe in cmd
-Input CSV? The path to .csv file goes here. 
-Channel? , chose the midi channel with the Melodie line you need, 0 to 15 (channel 0 is only the Header, channel 10 is normally Drums) you have to try. 
-Octave shift? , !Bongo+ has only 3 Octaves (C3 to H5) so Midi notes greater than this rollover and become lower notes again.  
Normal Note C4 is Midi value 60 is Keyboard key "Q" or "1" in BongoCat 
    When Octave Shift is 0 Bongo Key Q/1 is C3  
    When Octave Shift is 1 Bongo Key Q/1 is C4 (default)
    When Octave Shift is 2 Bongo Key Q/1 is C5

-Copy, paste text in chat, BongoCat will play it.
